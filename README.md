# Just-Another-Discord_Swarm
Collection of bots, apps, and tools for a specific Discord server

## Setup
Most of this is described [here](https://anidiots.guide/getting-started/getting-started-long-version), but for emphasis I've added the important steps here as well.
1. (will be changed) ask Alex for the bot app link
2. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Make sure you run `npm i -S discord.js` in path/to/dir/bots/bot_name (replacing `path/to/dir` with the location of your pulled repo)

   You should now see a `node_modules` directory in your path/to/dir/bots/bot_name directory.

4. Alter the bot's .js.template file as instructed in order to get it functional!

## More stuff to be added later!
